# Dataset splits

In both challenges, the data is split into `train/test/eval` sets.

In the first stage of the the competition, the `train/test` sets are provided
for training.
They contain only the ground-truth shapes, `Y`.
The partial data, `X`, is generated by the participants.
Some [example routines](../sharp/preprocess.py) are provided.
Custom routines may be used if reported.

At a later stage, the `eval` set is provided to generate the submission for the
final evaluation.
In this set, the partial data, `X`, is generated by the organisers and provided
to the participants.
The corresponding ground-truth shapes, `Y`, are kept secret.
